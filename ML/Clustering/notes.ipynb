    "### Clustering\n",
    "##### Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised ML technique used to group unlabeled data points based on their inherent similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comman Clustering problems: \n",
    "##### 1. K-Means Clustering\n",
    "##### 2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)\n",
    "##### 3. Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)\n",
    "##### 4. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)\n",
    "##### 5. Mean Shift Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. K-Means Clustering\n",
    "##### It is a centroid-based clustering algorithm. It partitions the data into 'K' distinct, non-overlapping clusters.\n",
    "##### It is also useful to work with above 2D data.\n",
    "##### K value could be even bcx in this k denotes clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps: \n",
    "##### 1- Decide n clusters.\n",
    "##### 2- Initiallize centriods.\n",
    "##### 3- Assign Cluster.\n",
    "##### 4- Move Centroids.\n",
    "##### 5- Finish\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The low distance data with newly centroids goes into that cluster.\n",
    "##### Suppose k=3, it randomly select 3 data as centriods.\n",
    "##### To move centroids after first cluster formed, we calculate the mean of features which are on x-axis and y-axis and then move to center.\n",
    "##### If current and previous centroids are equal then we stop otherwise we continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Elbow MEthod: It tell us how many cluster possible to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage: \n",
    "##### 1- Customer Segmentation.\n",
    "##### 2- Document clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks: \n",
    "##### Need to specify number of cluster before start.\n",
    "##### Different initializations can lead to different final clusters.\n",
    "##### Outliers can significantly skew(Direction or position change) the position of centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "##### DBSCAN or Mean Shift can handle non-spherical shapes and varying densities also handle outliers data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. DBSCAN\n",
    "##### It is a density-based algorithm. It groups together points that are closely packed (points with many nearby neighbors) and marks points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers or noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### MinPoints and Epsilon \n",
    "##### eps (Ïµ): The maximum distance between two samples.\n",
    "##### min_samples: The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Points, Border Points and Noise Points\n",
    "##### Core Points: Data is equal or greater than min_samples inside epsilon radius\n",
    "##### Border Points: Data which has low data compared to min_samples but at least one core points.\n",
    "##### Noise Points: If no border or core points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Density Connected Points:\n",
    "##### If 2 points are density connected then add in one cluster.\n",
    "##### If all pattern have same distance or d < epsilon, it means density connected.\n",
    "##### If distance > epsilon then it can't be connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps: \n",
    "##### 0- min_samples = 3, eps = 2(distance)\n",
    "##### 1- Identify all points as core, border or noise points.\n",
    "##### 2- For all of the unclustered points.\n",
    "#####   a- Create new cluster.\n",
    "#####   b- Add all the points that are unclustered and density connected to the current point into the cluster.\n",
    "##### 3- For each unclustered border point assign itto the cluster of nearest core points.\n",
    "##### 4- Leave all the noise points as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage: \n",
    "##### Robust to outliers. Built in capability to odentify outliers.\n",
    "##### No need to specify clusters.\n",
    "##### Can find arbitrary shaped clusters.\n",
    "##### Only 2 hyperparameters to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage: \n",
    "##### Clustering data with irregular shapes.\n",
    "##### Geospatial data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks: \n",
    "##### Performance can be sensitive to the choice of eps and min_samples, which can be hard to determine, especially if clusters have varying densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)\n",
    "##### In this the nearest two data make 1 cluster and it keep going untill 1 cluster form.\n",
    "##### Dentpgram: It has all record of clusters which were formed.\n",
    "##### We can stop the process of making clusters by skipping the rest when our desired number of cluster form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage:\n",
    "##### Gene expression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks:\n",
    "##### Computationally expensive: Can be slow for large datasets, O(N^^2 or N^^3).\n"
